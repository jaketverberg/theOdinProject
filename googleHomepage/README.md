This project is to recreate the Google homepage using basic HTML and CSS. 

I used CSS flexbox to create the layout, taking a lot more time than I thought it would need but rewarding to learn how it works and how useful/practical it is once I figured it out. 

Unfortunately, I did not know that adding a :hover effect on a parent would change the children of that parent. With my design, I was not able to add a :hover element (with my current knowlege) to the pill search area due to this issue.

I found that some of the page elements from my reference were not actually centered on the page. It was like Google purposefully did not center their content, leaving it just a little bit off center. All elements in this project are centered to the page exactly.

This project took me a few days due to only being able to work on it for an hour or so at a time and relearning/refreshing my memory on CSS Flexbox and the syntax.
